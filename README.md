# Location Tracking website
Hello guys, This is my new project of HTML, CSS, Javascript. This project is on tracking the location of somebody who visits this website. <br>
# Working of website:
1) On clicking the link of this website it will show a loading page of 10s.
2) Later it will redirect the user to the youtube video of rick roll
3) And the location of user will be sent to your telegram bot<br>
Note: Edit the script.js file to add your telegram bots token and chat ID.
